## How to run
* Use `git clone <path to repo>` cmd to clone the repository
* Once you clone repository, if not already in assignment 2. Use `cd assingment2`.
* Once inside use `bash run_tests.sh`, and to spin api server run `bash run_api.sh`

## How to test
* There is templates/index.html for e2e testing.

## GH workflows
* There is a workflow in github and it is ready to be run manually. 
* I have included one for tests, and one for server (just so we can check if docker is built).
